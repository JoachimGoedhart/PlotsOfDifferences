<h3>About PlotsOfDifferences</h3>
<p>The PlotsOfDifferences Shiny app plots the data, statistics and (optional) differences to enable the comparison of (experimental) conditions. The philosophy of the approach is that plotting the raw data (instead of a summary) improves transparency and interpretation (see also <a href="http://thenode.biologists.com/leaving-bar-five-steps/">this blog</a>). To further facilitate the comparison, summary statistics (mean, median, boxplot) and inferential statistics (confidence intervals) can be added. The user has full control over the visibility of the raw data and statistics by adjustment of the transparency (alpha). Finally, differences between central values (mean or median) can be quantified, reflecting effect size. To this end, a reference condition ('control') must be defined, which can be changed by the user. The 95%CI of the difference per condition is calculated from 1000 bootstrap samples (their distribution is shown in the difference plot) of the statistic (mean of median).</p>

<p>The data can be supplied in spreadsheet/long format (e.g. by copy-pasting from excel) or in tidy format. For more information on the conversion of spreadsheet data to tidy data see <a href="http://thenode.biologists.com/converting-excellent-spreadsheets-tidy-data/education/">this blog</a>.</p>


<p>The plot can be saved as a PDF file, which can be opened and edited with Adobe Illustrator to allow for fine adjustments of the lay-out.</p>

<p>The PlotsOfDifferences Shiny app is inspired by <a href="http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/">BoxPlotR</a>.</br>
